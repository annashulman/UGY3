# Introduction to GitHub for 1.5 Max
## Why is GitHub useful?
## Sign Up for GitHub
#### 1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/)
#### 2. Click on the 'Sign Up' button in the top right hand corner of your screen
#### 3. Follow the steps prompted by GitHub
Here, you're going to be asked to input the basics, like an email, passcode and username. Note that once you choose a username, it cannot be changed later on. Rather than via email, the username is how other collaborators on GitHub will be able to find and communicate with you. 

On a side note, it may be useful to create a document with everyone's names and GitHub usernames for reference when initiating a project.
#### 4. Your dashboard
After you create your account, you'll see your main GitHub dashboard. At the top of the screen there's a link to the [Hello World guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) GitHub offers as an introduction to the platform. I highly recommend taking a look at this, but I'll also go through and elaborate on bits of it here.
