# Introduction to GitHub for 1.5 Max
## Why is GitHub useful?
## Sign Up for GitHub
#### 1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/)
#### 2. Click on the 'Sign Up' button in the top right hand corner of your screen
#### 3. Follow the steps prompted by GitHub
Here, you're going to be asked to input the basics, like an email, passcode and username. Note that once you choose a username, it cannot be changed later on. Rather than via email, the username is how other collaborators on GitHub will be able to find and communicate with you. 

On a side note, it may be useful to create a document with everyone's names and GitHub usernames for reference when initiating a project.
#### 4. Your dashboard
After you create your account, you'll see your main GitHub dashboard. You can always come back to this dashboard by clicking this icon on the top left hand side of the menu bar: <br>

(As an aside, this ^^ icon is an 'octocat', which is GitHub's logo.)

At the top of the screen there's also a link to the [Hello World guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) GitHub offers as an introduction to the platform. I highly recommend taking a look at this, but I'll also go through and elaborate on bits of it here. <br>

## Create a repository
## READMEs
## Create a new file
## Using Markdown

## Issues
The Issues in GitHub is a multipurpose tool to communicate with other repository collaborators. This is one of my favourite functions in GitHub. Most often, it is used when someone has a question/problem they would like another collaborator to take a look at. Other times, it can also be used to give outlining structure to a project. For example, you can open an issue to assign project tasks and goals each week. 
A useful aside: You can opt into receiving email notifications from GitHub. These will then notify you via email when an issue is opened, or when someone responds to an issue within a repository you're a part of. 

Here's how to open an issue:

#### 1. Click the 'Issues' tab in the menu bar at the top of your screen

#### 2. Click the 'New Issue' button

#### 3. Describe the problem
GitHub will prompt you to add a title and a description of what you would like to include in your issue. The title is what everyone will immediately when scrolling through the issues, so it is good to make these short and informative -- easily understandable at a glance, essentially. 

To help with organisation and clarity, GitHub also allows you to add tags to your issue, e.g. "bug problem" or "weekly agenda". These tags can be created and re-used in different issues throughout the repository. For when a repository accumulates a lot of issues, you can find a specific one by inputing a tag into the search bar.

The description of issues follows the same format as a standard .md file. This means you can use headers, images, code/bold/italics text to help other collaborators understand a problem that you are having.

#### 4. Click 'Submit New Issue"

## Download GitHub Desktop Version
### What's the difference between the online and desktop versions of GitHub?
The online version of GitHub is the published version. This is the version that other collaborators viewing the files you upload will see. GitHub Desktop allows you to save a local version of GitHub repositories to your own computer. This will allow you to edit/add/delete files locally, but be aware that *such changes will not appear online until you 'push' them online* (more on this process later). 

While you can edit/add/delete files in the online version (e.g. .md documents), it may be easier for you to have your own local copies of repositories and documents to work on and upload to the published version when you are ready. 

Here's how to download the desktop version:

#### 1. Go to [desktop.github.com](desktop.github.com)
#### 2. For mac users, click on ['Download for macOS'](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin); below this button there is an option for [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32) users as well.
For me, GitHub Desktop appeared in my 'Downloads' folder. You can move this to where ever you like on your computer; I keep it in my 'Applications' folder.
#### 3. Open GitHub Desktop and click 'Sign in to GitHub.com'

Your account information may already populate the screen, but if not, you may have to log in again.
#### 4. Click 'Authorize Desktop'
This will open GitHub Desktop again, and your username should autopopulate a form. After confirming this step, your GitHub Desktop and online GitHub account should be linked.

** Also please let me know if y'all have any problems with GitHub Desktop -- I access GitHub locally on my computer through R, rather than GitHub Desktop, so I don't have a lot of experience with Desktop. Both processes seem to give the end result, but GitHub Desktop seems a lot friendlier to folks who don't code -- hence why I included it here. 

## Version Control

## Your profile
The last point I wanted to touch on in this brief introduction is customising your account. 
In the online version, you can view your profile by clicking the small circle icon in the top right hand side of your screen and selecting 'Your Profile'.  
<img width="167" alt="Screenshot 2022-02-19 at 18 00 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91272561/154813183-dab4e4b0-045d-419a-b3f7-a5a7d7f4e543.png"> <br>
From here, you add a profile picture, bio, links to social media accounts, the works. You can also see any repositories you have created as well as any activity you've done, from up to a full year ago. <br>

----- <br>
This was just an introduction to downloading and using GitHub -- at first, it can seem like a complicated platform, but it gets easier and is really wonderful due to its version control. This document is also limited, GitHub has many other wonderful features, such as Pull Requests and Projects that I would be happy to go into later on if you all found this useful and want to know more. Please let me know if there were parts of this you found difficult to follow, and I can go back and clarify any points of confusion.
