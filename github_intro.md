# Introduction to GitHub for 1.5 Max
## Why is GitHub useful?
## Sign Up for GitHub
#### 1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/)
#### 2. Click on the 'Sign Up' button in the top right hand corner of your screen
#### 3. Follow the steps prompted by GitHub
Here, you're going to be asked to input the basics, like an email, passcode and username. Note that once you choose a username, it cannot be changed later on. Rather than via email, the username is how other collaborators on GitHub will be able to find and communicate with you. 

On a side note, it may be useful to create a document with everyone's names and GitHub usernames for reference when initiating a project.
#### 4. Your dashboard
After you create your account, you'll see your main GitHub dashboard. At the top of the screen there's a link to the [Hello World guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) GitHub offers as an introduction to the platform. I highly recommend taking a look at this, but I'll also go through and elaborate on bits of it here. <br>

## Download GitHub Desktop Version
### What's the difference between the online and desktop versions of GitHub?
The online version of GitHub is the published version. This is the version that other collaborators viewing the files you upload will see. GitHub Desktop allows you to save a local version of GitHub repositories to your own computer. This will allow you to edit/add/delete files locally, but be aware that *such changes will not appear online until you 'push' them online* (more on this process later). 

While you can edit/add/delete files in the online version (e.g. .md documents), it may be easier for you to have your own local copies of repositories and documents to work on and upload to the published version when you are ready. 

Here's how to download the desktop version:

#### 1. Go to [desktop.github.com](desktop.github.com)
#### 2. For mac users, click on ['Download for macOS'](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin); below this button there is an option for [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32) users as well.
For me, GitHub Desktop appeared in my 'Downloads' folder. You can move this to where ever you like on your computer; I keep it in my 'Applications' folder.
#### 3. Open GitHub Desktop and click 'Sign in to GitHub.com'

Your account information may already populate the screen, but if not, you may have to log in again.
#### 4. Click 'Authorize Desktop'
This will open GitHub Desktop again, and your username should autopopulate a form. After confirming this step, your GitHub Desktop and online GitHub account should be linked.
